If you are signing up to any of Gospel Powered's subscription plans we will handle all the installation for you. No need to set your template up, we do the hard work so you can concentrate on what's important. 

If you haven't signed up for one of our plans you may want to check them out [here](http://www.gospelpowered.com/index.php/pricing)
However, if you are purchasing one of our templates separately, or simply want to do the installation yourself the following documentation is provided. The  general section of this documentation applies to all our Joomla! templates. Available templates can be found [here](http://www.gospelpowered.com/index.php/templates)

The following provides a brief checklist before you get started.
1. A web domain
2. Web hosting
3. Recommended that you install an ftp client.
